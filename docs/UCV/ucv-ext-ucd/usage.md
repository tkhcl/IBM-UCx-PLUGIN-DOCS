Urbancode Deploy - Usage
===================

# Usage


## Usage



To use the UrbanCode Deploy plugin, the plugin must be loaded and an instance created before you can configure the plugin integration. You define configuration properties in the user interface or in a JSON file.

### Integration type
----------------

The UrbanCode Deploy plugin supports scheduled events integration which are listed in the following table.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| syncDeployEvent | Timed event that synchronizes with UrbanCode Deploy |

### Integration
--------------------

There are two methods to integrate the plug-in:

* Using the user interface
* Using a JSON file

The tables in the Configuration properties topic describe the properties used to define the integration.

### Using the user interface

* From the Plugins page, click **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Plugins**.
* Under the **Action** column for the plug-in, click **Add Integration**.
* On the Add Integration page enter values for the fields used to configure the integration and define communication.
* Click **Save**.

### Using a JSON file

The JSON file contains the information for creating a value stream. Within the JSON file is a section for integrations. It is in this section that plug-in properties can be defined.

   * From a value stream page, download the value stream map. The value stream map is a JSON file used to define integrations.
   * Edit the JSON file to include the plug-in configuration properties.
   * Save and upload the JSON file. This replaces the current JSON file with the new content.
   * View the new integration on the Integrations page.

### Configuration Properties

The following tables describe the properties used to configure the integration. Each table contains the field name when using the user interface and the property name when using a JSON file.

   * The General Configuration Properties table describes configuration properties used by all plug-in integrations.
   * The UrbanCode Deploy Configuration Properties table describes the configuration properties that define the connection and communications with the UrbanCode Deploy server. When using the JSON method to integrate the plug-in these properties are coded within the properties configuration property.

Some properties might not be displayed in the user interface, to see all properties enable the **Show Hidden Properties** field.

#### General Configuration Properties
