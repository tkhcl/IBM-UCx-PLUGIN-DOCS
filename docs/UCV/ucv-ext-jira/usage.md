# Jira - Usage

To use the Jira plug-in, the plug-in must be loaded and an instance created before you can configure the plug-in integration. You define configuration properties in the user interface or in a JSON file.

## Integration type

The Jira plug-in supports scheduled events integration which are listed in the following table.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| SyncJiraDataEvent | Synchronize data from a Jira server. |

## Integration

There are two methods to integrate the plug-in:

* Using the user interface
* Using a JSON file

The tables in the Configuration properties topic describe the properties used to define the integration.

### Using the user interface

1. From the Plugins page, click **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Plugins**.
2. Under the **Action** column for the plug-in, click **Add Integration**.
3. On the Add Integration page enter values for the fields used to configure the integration and define communication.
4. Click **Save**.

### Using a JSON file

The JSON file contains the information for creating a value stream. Within the JSON file is a section for integrations. It is in this section that plug-in properties can be defined.

1. From a value stream page, download the value stream map. The value stream map is a JSON file used to define integrations.
2. Edit the JSON file to include the plug-in configuration properties.
3. Save and upload the JSON file. This replaces the current JSON file with the new content.
4. View the new integration on the Integrations page.

## Configuration properties

The following tables describe the properties used to configure the integration. Each table contains the field name when using the user interface and the property name when using a JSON file.

* The General Configuration Properties table describes configuration properties used by all plug-in integrations.
* The Jira Configuration Properties table describes the configuration properties that define the connection and communications with the Jira server. When using the JSON method to integrate the plug-in these properties are coded within the `properties` configuration property.

## Example

The following example can be used as a template to include the Jira plug-in integration into the JSON file. Copy and paste the template into the JSON file
and make the appropriate changes.

```json

"integrations": [ {
"type": "ucv-ext-jira",
"tenant_id": "*tenantid*",
"name": "Jira_Plugin ",
"properties": {
    "baseUrl": "*jira_server_url*",
    "username": "*jira_server_user_name*",
    "password": "*jira_server_password*",
    "consumer_key": null,
    "consumer_secret": null,
    "access_token": null,
    "access_token_secret": null,
    "jiraJql":"*project in ("John-Project")*",
    "proxyServer": "*proxy_server_url*",
    "proxyUsername": "*proxy_server_user_name*",
