HCL OneTest Server - Usage
==========================

# Usage



### Usage






To use the HCL OneTest Server plug-in you must define the integration, create a value stream, and 
upload the integration.


The value stream map contains the properties, you will use to define the plug-in integration. 
Basically, the plug-in integration is defined with a value stream within the UrbanCode Velocity user interface. Defining
 the integration includes defining configuration properties that connect the UrbanCode Velocity server to the OneTest 
server.


The basic flow to use the plug-in includes:


1. Download the value stream map. The value stream map is a JSON
 file used to define integrations.
2. Edit the JSON file to include the plug-in configuration properties.
3. Save and 
upload the JSON file. This replaces the current JSON file with the new content.
4. View the new integration on the 
Integration user interface page.


You can map a build to a metric using tags defined on the OneTest server by 
evaluating the tag against a regular express. Use the Build Label Pattern field to define the regular expression. For 
example, a build expression of “([A-Z]+-[0-9]+)” and a test has a tag of “BUILD-123”, the build is mapped with ID 
BUILD-123 in the UrbanCode Velocity server to the newly created metric. For assistance in forming a regular expression, 
see the [Regular expression tester](https://regexr.com) website. You can use the website to help form and test a regular
 expression based on your build ID.


Integration type
----------------


The HCL OneTest Server plug-in supports 
endpoint integration which are listed in the following table.




| Name | Path | Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
OneTestEndpoint | onetest/callback | Post |


Integration
-----------


From the user interface Value Steam page, click 
**Upload** to upload the value stream map which is a JSON file.


The JSON file contains the information for creating a 
value stream and integrating with the OneTest server. The following table describes the information for the creating a 
UrbanCode Velocity value stream map.




| Name | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| image | The version of 
the plug-in that you want to use. To view available versions, see the [UrbanCode

messages to log. Valid values are: all, debug, info, warn, error, fatal, off, and trace. The default is info. | No |
| 
properties | List of [configuration properties](#properties) used to connect and communicate with the OneTest server. 
Enclose the properties within braces. | Yes |
| tenant\_id | The name of the tenant. | Yes |
| type | Unique identifier 
assigned to the plug-in. The value for the HCL OneTest server plug-in is `ucv-ext-onetest-server`. | Yes |


### 
Configuration Properties


The configuration properties which are included in the `properties` field are unique to the 
HCL OneTest Server plug-in and define the connection and communication to the OneTest server.




| Name | Property Name
 | Type | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Build Label Pattern | buildRegExp | String | A 
regular expression pattern that will match a build ID on a test execution label. For example: ([A-Z]+-[0-9]+). | No |

interface by clicking the Create Token button. | Yes |
| HCL OneTest Server URL | oneTestUrl | String | The base URL of 
the HCL OneTest Server. For example: https://tp-cicd2.nonprod.hclpnp.com. | Yes |



| UrbanCode Velocity User Access 
Key | ucvAccessKey | String | The user access key to authenticate with the UrbanCode Velocity server. | Yes |


Example

-------


The following example can be used as as template to include the AppScan plug-in integration into the JSON 
file. Copy and paste the template into the JSON file and make the appropriate changes.



```

"integrations": [
  {

    "type": "ucv-ext-onetest-server",
    "tenant_id": "",
    "name": "",
    "logginglevel": "INFO",
    
"properties":{
      "ucvAccessKey": "",
      "oneTestUrl" : "",
      "oneTestRefreshToken":"",
      
"buildRegExp": "([A-Z]+-[0-9]+)"
   }``
}``
]
