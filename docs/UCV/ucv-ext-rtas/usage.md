Rational Test Automation Server - Usage
=======================================

# Usage



### Usage




To use the Rational Test Automation Server plug-in, the plug-in must be loaded and an instance created 
before you can configure the plug-in integration. You define configuration properties in the user interface or in a JSON
 file.To invoke the plug-in, you must send an HTTP Post to request the plug-in endpoint.


Integration type

----------------


The Rational Test Automation Server plug-in supports endpoint integration which are listed in the 
following table.




| Name | Path | Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RTASEndpoint | rtas/callback | Post |


### Send the
 HTTP Post


To gather data, send an HTTP POST request to your endpoint:  `https:///pluginEndpoint//rtas/callback` 



The payload for this POST must be in the following format: 



```
{
  "project": {
    "name":"",
    "id": ""
    
(either project name or project id must be specified)
  }``,
  "test": {
    "name":"",
    "path":"
    (either 
test name or test path must be specified)
  }``,
  "commitId": " (optional),
  "build": {
    "id": "",
    "url": 
""
  }`` (optional, this will override buildRegExp if specified)
}``
```

 


**commitID** is the SHA of the commit. 
You can either not link it to anything in UrbanCode Velocity, or you can link it to a build, or to a commit (will 
accomplish the same thing in the end, by making the metric show up on the DOT). There are some IDs that are readily 
available when orchestrating from a Jenkins job for instance (such as the BUILD\_ID).


You can map a build to a metric 
using tags defined on the Rational Test Automation Server by evaluating the tag against a regular express. Use the 
**Build Label Pattern** field to define the regular expression. For example, a build expression of “([A-Z]+-[0-9]+)” and
 a test has a tag of “BUILD-123”, the build is mapped with ID BUILD-123 in the UrbanCode Velocity server to the newly 
created metric. For assistance in forming a regular expression, see the [Regular expression tester](https://regexr.com) 
website. You can use the website to help form and test a regular expression based on your build ID.


Integration

-----------


There are two methods to integrate the plug-in:


* Using the user interface
* Using a JSON file


### 
Using the user interface


1. From the Plugins page, click **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Plugins**.
2. Under the 
Action column for the plug-in, click **Add Integration**.
3. On the Add Integration page enter values for the fields 
used to configure the integration and define communication.
4. Click **Save**.


### Using a JSON file


The JSON file 
contains the information for creating a value stream and integrating with the IBM Rational Test Automation Server 
server. The following table describes the information for the creating a HCL Accelerate value stream map.


1. Download 
the value stream map. The value stream map is a JSON file used to define integrations.
2. Edit the JSON file to include 
the plug-in configuration properties.
3. Save and upload the JSON file. This replaces the current JSON file with the new
 content.
4. View the new integration on the Integrations page.


Configuration properties
------------------------



The following tables describe the properties used to configure the integration. Each table contains the field name when 
using the user interface and the property name when using a JSON file.


* The General Configuration Properties table 
describes configuration properties used by all plug-in integrations.
* The Rational Test Automation Server Configuration
 Properties table describes the configuration properties that define the connection and communications with the Rational
 Test Automation Server server. When using the JSON method to integrate the plug-in these properties are coded within 
the `properties` configuration property.




| Name | Description | Required | Property Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| NA | The version of the plug-in that you want to use. To view available versions, click the **Version History** tab. 
If a value is not specified, the version named latest is used. | No | image |
| Integration Name | An assigned name to 
the value stream. | Yes | name |
| Logging Level | The level of Log4j messages to display in the log file. Valid values 
are: all, debug, info, warn, error, fatal, off, and trace. | No | loggingLevel |
| NA | List of plug-in configuration 
properties used to connect and communicate with the Rational Test Automation Server server. Enclose the properties 
within braces. | Yes | properties |
|  | The name of the tenant. | Yes | tenant\_id |
| NA | Unique identifier assigned 
to the plug-in. The value for the Rational Test Automation Server plug-in is `ucv-ext-rtas` | Yes | type |




| Name | 
Property Name | Type | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Build Label Pattern | buildRegExp | 
String | A regular expression pattern to match a build ID on a test execution label. For example: ([A-Z]+-[0-9]+). | No 
|
| Rational Test Automation Server Offline User Token | rtasOfflineToken | String | The offline user token created in 
the Rational Test Automation Server user interface by clicking the Create Token button. | Yes |
| Rational Test 
Automation Server URL | rtasUrl | String | The base URL of the Rational Test Automation Server. For example: https://tp-
cicd2.nonprod.hclpnp.com. | Yes |
| UrbanCode Velocity User Access Key | ucvAccessKey | String | The user access key 
used to authenticate with the UrbanCode Velocity server. | Yes |


### Example


The following example can be used as as
 template to include the AppScan plug-in integration into the JSON file. Copy and paste the template into the JSON file 
and make the appropriate changes.



```

"integrations": [
  {
    "type": "ucv-ext-rtas",
    "tenant_id": 
"*tenant-id*",
    "name": "*integration-name*",
    "logginglevel": "*log\_level\_value*",
    "properties":{

      "ucvAccessKey": "*ucv-user-access-key*",
      "rtasUrl" : "*rtas-url*",
      "rtasOfflineToken":"*rtas-
offline-token*",
      "buildRegExp": "([A-Z]+-[0-9]+)"
   }``
}``
]

```
