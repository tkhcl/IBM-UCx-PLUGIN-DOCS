Azure DevOps - Usage
====================

# Usage


### Usage


To use the Azure DevOps plug-in, the plug-in must be loaded and an instance created before you can
configure the plug-in integration. You define configuration properties in the user interface or in a JSON file.


Integration type
----------------

The Azure DevOps plug-in supports scheduled events integration which are listed in
the following table.


| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| SyncAzureIssuesEvent | Queries the Query Azure DevOps
server for new or updated pull requests and commits. |
| SyncAzureGitDataEvent | Queries the Azure DevOps server for new
or updated work items. |
| SyncAzureBuildsEvent | Queries the Query Azure DevOps server for build data. |
|
SyncAzurePipelines | Queries the Azure DevOps server for deployment data. |

Integration
-----------

There are two
methods to integrate the plug-in:

* Using the user interface
* Using a JSON file

The tables in the Configuration
properties topic describe the properties used to define the integration.

#### Using the user interface

1. From the
Plugins page, click **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Plugins**.
2. Under the **Action** column for the plug-in, click
**Add Integration**.
3. On the Add Integration page enter values for the fields used to configure the integration and
define communication.
4. Click **Save**.

#### Using a JSON file

The JSON file contains the information for creating
a value stream. Within the JSON file is a section for integrations. It is in this section that plug-in properties can be
defined.

1. From a value stream page, download the value stream map. The value stream map is a JSON file used to
define integrations.
2. Edit the JSON file to include the plug-in configuration properties.
3. Save and upload the JSON
file. This replaces the current JSON file with the new content.
4. View the new integration on the Integrations page.


Configuration Properties
------------------------

The following tables describe the properties used to configure the
integration. Each table contains the field name when using the user interface and the property name when using a JSON
file.

* The General Configuration Properties table describes configuration properties used by all plug-in
integrations.
* The Azure DevOps Properties table describes the Azure DevOps configuration properties are unique to the
Azure DevOps plug-in and define the connection and communication to the Azure DevOps server. When using the JSON method
to integrate the plug-in these properties are coded within the `properties` configuration property.
