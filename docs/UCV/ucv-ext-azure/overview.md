# Azure DevOps - Overview

The Azure DevOps (formerly *Microsoft Team Foundation Server or TFS*) plug-in provides for integration with an Azure DevOps server. This plug-in imports work items, commits, pull requests and deployment data from an Azure DevOps server and saves them as UrbanCode Velocity issues. Data between the Azure DevOps server and the UrbanCode Velocity server is synchronized every five minutes.

## Compatibility

Must be running UrbanCode Velocity version 1.2.1 and later to use the plug-in.

## Versions
