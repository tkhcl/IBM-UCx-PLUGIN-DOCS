Cucumber - Overview
===================

# Overview



### Overview




 


The Cucumber plug-in automates running Cucumber test scenarios. Test scenarios are based on 
Behavior Driven Development (BDD) written to test product features.


Cucumber test scenarios are written using the 
Gherkin syntax. Each scenario contains a set of steps that are verified processed by the Cucumber tool. A report of 
success or failure is generated for each scenario. Scenarios are stored as .feature text files. Step Definitions, 
referred to as glue contain a Java method linking to one or more scenario steps.
