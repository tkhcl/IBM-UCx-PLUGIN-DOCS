# GitHub - Usage

## Usage

To use the GitHub plug-in, the plug-in must be loaded and an instance created before you can configure the plug-in integration. Configuration properties are defined using the product user interface or a JSON file.

### Integration type

The GitHub plug-in supports scheduled events integration which are listed in the following table.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| syncGithubIssuesEvent | Queries the GitHub repository for issues. |
| syncGithubCommitsEvent | Queries the GitHub repository for commits. |
| syncGithubPullRequestsEvent | Queries the GitHub repository for pull requests. |

### Integration

here are two methods to integrate the plug-in:

* Using the user interface
* Using a JSON file

The tables in the Configuration properties topic describe the properties used to define the integration.

#### Using the user interface

1. From the Plugins page, click **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Plugins**.
2. Under the **Action** column for the plug-in, click **Add Integration**.
3. On the Add Integration page enter values for the fields used to configure the integration and define communication.
4. Click **Save**.

#### Using a JSON file

The JSON file contains the information for creating a value stream. Within the JSON file is a section for integrations. It is in this section that plug-in properties can be defined.

1. From a value stream page, download the value stream map. The value stream map is a JSON file used to define integrations.
2. Edit the JSON file to include the plug-in configuration properties.
3. Save and upload the JSON file. This replaces the current JSON file with the new content.
4. View the new integration on the Integrations page.

### Configuration properties

The following tables describe the properties used to configure the integration. Each table contains the field name when using the user interface and the property name when using a JSON file.

* The General Configuration Properties table describes configuration properties used by all plug-in integrations.
* The GitHub Configuration Properties table describes the GitHub configuration properties that define the connection and communications with the GitHub server. When using the JSON method to integrate the plug-in these properties are coded within the `properties` configuration property.

| Name | Description | Required | Property Name |

| Proxy Password | String | The password used to authenticate with the proxy server. | No | proxyPassword |

#### JSON code example

The following example can be used as a template to define the integration within the JSON file for a value stream. Copy and paste the template into the JSON file and make the appropriate changes.

```json

"integrations":[
{
"type":"ucv-ext-github",
"tenant_id":"tenant-id",

"name":"github-integration-name",
"properties":{
"owner":"owner-name",

"repositories":[
"repo1",
"repo2",
"repo3"
],

"apiUrl":"github-api-url",
"token":"generated-token",
"ucvAccessKey":"generated-access-key",

"proxyServer": "*proxy_server_url*",
"proxyUsername": "*proxy_server_user_name*",

"proxyPassword": "*proxy_server_password*"
}``
}``
]

```
