==================

# Overview


### Overview


CICS Transaction Server for z/OS provides scalable, general-purpose, transaction processing solutions for high-volume updates to shared data. Businesses have used CICS to differentiate themselves by creating, extending, and evolving their critical applications.

You can use steps from the CICS TS plug-in for UrbanCode Deploy, in combination with other plug-ins,to automate the deployment and undeployment of CICS applications.

In a wider context, the CICS TS plug-in can be used in conjunction with other CICS tooling to automate the build and deployment of CICS artifacts as part of a continuous delivery environment.

### Features

The plug-in includes steps to:

* Install CSD resources, groups, and lists
* Install BAS resources, resourcedescriptions, and groups
* Discard resources
* Enable and disable resources
* Open and close resources
* New copy and phase in resources
* Make resources available and unavailable
* Check the available, enable,and openstatus of resources
* Scan pipelines
* Deploy and undeploy a bundle
* Deploy and undeploy an application
* Check the status of an application
* Enableand disable an application
* Make an application available and unavailable

Compatiblity
------------

The CICS TS plug-in is supported to run against any of the following CICS editions:

* IBM CICS Transaction Server for z/OS V5.1, V5.2, V5.3, V5.4, V5.5, V5.6
* IBM CICS Transaction Server for z/OS Developer Trial V5.1, V5.2, V5.3, V5.4, V5.5, V5.6
* IBM CICS Transaction Server for z/OS Value Unit Edition V5.1, V5.2, V5.3, V5.4, V5.5, V5.6

Additionally, you must also have configured a CICS management client interface (CMCI) port, as described in topic [Setting up access for CICS Explorer](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.4.0/configuring/cmci/clientapi_setup.html) in the IBM Knowledge Center.

This plug-in requires UrbanCode Deploy 6.2.5 or later, and the [zOS Utility](https://urbancode.github.io/IBM-UCx-PLUGIN-DOCS/UCD/zos-deploy/) 10 plug-in or later. Using this plug-in requires the UrbanCode Deploy agent to be running with Java 8; for details of how to upgrade the version of Java used by the agent, see [Changing or updating the JRE of agents](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4GSP_6.2.4/com.ibm.udeploy.doc/topics/jre_change_agent.html).

### Required fixes

CICS TS V5.1 or CICS TS V5.2 with [APAR PI56706](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=1083&context=SSGMGV&q=&uid=swg1PI56706&loc=en_US&cs=utf-8&lang=en en), or CICS TS V5.3 or above is required for the following CICS TS plug-in steps. These steps also require the UCD agent to run in the same sysplex as the target CICSPlex SM CMAS region:

* Deploy bundle, Undeploy bundles
* Deploy application, Undeploy application

CICS TS V5.3 or above is required for the following CICS TS plug-in steps:

* Phase in resources for the resource type of Bundle

Installation
------------

No special steps are required for installation. See [Installing plug-ins in UrbanCode Deploy](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/wasdevops/blogs/laurel-dickson-bull1/2022/06/13/install-plugins "Installing plug-ins in UrbanCode Deploy").
