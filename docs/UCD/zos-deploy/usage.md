### Running MVS system commands





The Run 
MVS Command step uses the Java programming interface with the System Display and Search Facility (SDSF) to run MVS 
system commands on the agent. To use the Run MVS Command step, you must work with your system administrator to configure
 security properly for the agent user account. In the following examples, protecting resources by setting the universal 
access authority (UACC) to NONE might prevent all users, except users with explicit permission, from accessing the 
protected command.


The agent user account must be authorized to use SDSF from Java and must be authorized to issue MVS
 slash (/) commands from SDSF. MVS commands are protected by defining a resource name in the SDSF class, as shown in the
 following table.




| Resource name | Class | Access |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ISFOPER.SYSTEM | SDSF | READ |


If the 
SDSF class is not activated yet, use following command to activate itfirst. SETROPTS CLASSACT(SDSF)


To use the 
Resource Access Control Facility (RACF) to authorize the use of an MVS command, issue commands similar to the commands 
in the following examples: RDEFINE SDSF ISFOPER.SYSTEM UACC(NONE) PERMIT ISFOPER.SYSTEM CLASS(SDSF) ID(userid or 
groupid) ACCESS(READ)


Additionally, the agent user account must be authorized to use the ULOG command to view command 
responses. MVS commands can return responses to the user console and to the user log (ULOG). The ULOG command is 
protected a resource in the SDSF class, as shown in the following table.




| Resource name | Class | Access |
| --- | 
--- | --- |
| ISFCMD.ODSP.ULOG.*jesx* | SDSF | READ |


To use the Resource Access Control Facility (RACF) to authorize 
the use of the ULOG command, issue commands similar to the commands in the following example. RDEFINE SDSF 
ISFCMD.ODSP.ULOG.* UACC(NONE) PERMIT ISFCMD.ODSP.ULOG.* CLASS(SDSF) ID(userid or groupid) ACCESS(READ)


Run following 
command to make your changes to profiles effective. SETROPTS RACLIST(SDSF) REFRESH


For more information on setting up 
SDSF security, see the documentation available at [System Display and Search 
Facility](http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/features/sdsf/isflib.html "System Display and Search Facility").


The 
following settings show an example of how to configure the Run MVS Command step.

### Using custom properties in deployments





You can add custom properties to data sets or to members when you 
create component versions. The custom properties can then be used by the Generate Artifact Information step to generate 
commands or other input that can be used by other subsequent steps in the process.


Before you can use the Generate 
Artifact Information step, a component version must be deployed by using the Deploy Data Sets step.


In the following 
example, a custom property is used to generate IBM DB2 database commands.


The following shiplist file shows the DB2 
plan name as a custom property to the DBRM data set:



```
<manifest type="MANIFEST\_SHIPLIST">
 <container 
name="TONY.MORT.DEV.LOAD" type="PDS" deployType="CICS\_LOAD">
 <resource name="JKECMORT" type="PDSMember"/>
 
</container>
 <container name="TONY.MORT.DEV.DBRM" type="PDS" deployType="DBRM">
  **<property name="plan" 
value="TONY"/>**
 <resource name="*" type="PDSMember"/>
 </container>
</manifest>
```

When you create a component 
version by using this shiplist file, the custom property is visible in the version artifacts view. Properties added to a
 data set are also visible to all members of the data set.


[![zos_props_1](zos_props_1.png)](zos_props_1.png)


In the
 following deployment process, the FTP Artifacts and Deploy Data Sets steps deploy the members to the target system. The
 Generate Artifact Information step generates TSO commands that are then used to run the REXX BIND commands. The 
generated commands contain the DB2 plan name from the custom property. The generated commands are then run by the Run 
TSO or ISPF Command.


![](zos_props_2.png?resize=640%2C189) The Generate Artifact Information step uses the following 
settings:


[![zos_props_3](zos_props_3.png)](zos_props_3.png)


Use ``${*propertyName*}`` to refer to a custom 
property. In the previous example, TEST.REXX(BIND) is a REXX script that accepts plan, library, and member values as 
parameters and then runs the DB2 DSN BIND command.


The Generate Artifact Information step generates the following 
output properties. In this example, the **text** property contains the generated TSO commands.



[![zos_props_4](zos_props_4.png)](zos_props_4.png)


In this example, the Run TSO or ISPF Command step uses the 
following settings:


![](zos_props_5.png?resize=640%2C189)




### Deploying data sets and running CICS commands






### Example: Deploying data sets and running CICS commands


In this process example, the z/OS data sets must be in the 
component. Also, the environment contains agents that are running z/OS. In addition to the z/OS Utility plug-in, the 
CICS TS plug-in must be installed. The process runs the following steps in order:


1. The [Copy 
Artifacts](https://www.urbancode.com/plugindoc/z-os-utility#tab-steps) step loads the artifacts that make up the z/OS 
component version.
2. The [Deploy Data Sets](https://www.urbancode.com/plugindoc/z-os-utility#tab-steps) step deploys 
the component version to z/OS.
3. The [Generate Artifact Information](https://www.urbancode.com/plugindoc/z-os-
utility#tab-steps) step generates a list of CICS members.
4. The [NEWCOPY 
Programs](https://www.urbancode.com/2019/05/15/steps-to-install-ucd-7-0-2-agent-on-z-os-and-ucd-server-on-windows/) 
step, in the CICS TS plug-in, runs the NEWCOPY command on the members.


[![zos_cics_1](zos_cics_1.png)](zos_cics_1.png)



In this example, the Generate Artifact Information step is configured with the following properties:



![](zos_cics_2.png?resize=640%2C189) The output of the Generate Artifact Information step looks similar to the following
 properties:


![](zos_cics_3.png?resize=640%2C189) In this example, the NEWCOPY Programs step is configured with the 
following properties:


[![zos_cics_4](zos_cics_4.png)](zos_cics_4.png)


The execution log of the NEWCOPY Programs step
 looks similar to the following output:



```
PerformNEWCOPY:
```



```
Info:NEWCOPY "JKEMLIST" succeeded.
```


```

Info:NEWCOPY "JKEMORT" succeeded.
```


```
Info:NEWCOPY "JKEBXXC2" succeeded.

### Submitting JCL jobs from a template





To submit a JCL job from a template, use the 
[Submit Job](https://www.urbancode.com/plugindoc/ibmucd/zos-utility-plug/1-2/steps/#submit_job) step, and then set up 
the step properties similar to the following example: 
[![submit_job_template](submit_job_template.gif)](submit_job_template.gif) To submit multiple jobs from the same 
template, specify multiple sets of rules in the **Replace Tokens For Each Job** field. Separate rule sets with a new 
line that contains only two forward slashes (//). The status of the Submit Job step is success if all of the jobs run to
 completion, and fail if any of the jobs fail. Multiple jobs run in sequence, and use the same settings for job output 
and status checking. If you select **Stop On Fail**, no subsequent jobs are run after a job fails. To submit multiple 
jobs that check the existence of multiple data set members, set up the step properties similar to the following example:
 [![zos_multiplejobs](zos_multiplejobs.png)](zos_multiplejobs.png) In the previous example, three jobs are submitted 
because three rule sets are specified in the **Replace Tokens For Each Job** field. The three jobs check the JKEMPMT, 
JKECMORT, and JKEMLIST members in that order. The rules that are specified in the **Replace Tokens** field are used for 
all jobs. Because **Stop On Fail** is selected, if any job fails no subsequent jobs are submitted. Finally, the **Max 
Return Code** field is set to 0 so that any return code greater than 0 is considered a job failure. For example, a 
return code of 4 from the LISTDS command, which indicates that a member name was not found, is considered a job failure.



### Processing multiple data sets or data set members


Use the Generate Artifact Information step to process each 
data set or data set member in a version. In the following example, the process verifies that data set members are 
deployed. [![zos_multipleproc](zos_multipleproc.png)](zos_multipleproc.png) The Generate Artifact Information step uses 
the following settings: [![zos_genjobparams](zos_genjobparams.png)](zos_genjobparams.png) The Submit Job step uses the 
following settings: [![zos_check](zos_check.png)](zos_check.png)




### Deploying HFS files



A component version of 
HFS files can be deployed in either old format or new format of HFS directory mapping. In the old format of HFS 
directory mapping, it accepts only the target directory as input and during deployment, the container directories are 
created, and files are moved to the respective container. Mapping is in the below format`Target-Directory-path`Whereas 
the new format of HFS directory mapping, follows the same rule as for deploying the MVS Datasets. The mapping may 
contain multiple lines with each line in the below format
`Source-Container-Name, Target-Directory-path`


On contrary 
to old format the deployment with new format does not create a sub-directory of source container while moving to target 
directory. 




### Deploying by using the Job Monitor


Refer [Deploying by using the Job 
Monitor](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/urbancode-
deploy/7.2.2?topic=SS4GSP_7.2.2/com.ibm.udeploy.install.doc/topics/zos_using_job_monitor.html) for more details




### 
Managing redundant versions





### Managing redundant versions


Redundant versions are incremental versions that are 
replaced by one or more subsequent incremental versions. In the following example, when Version 2 is deployed Version 1 
becomes a redundant version, because all artifacts that are deployed with Version 1 are replaced by Version 2.



[![redundant_versions](redundant_versions.gif)](redundant_versions.gif)


### Remove Redundant Versions


The **Remove 
Redundant Versions** plug-in step removes redundant versions from the inventory.


### Snapshots


Redundant versions 
are excluded when you create a snapshot. This exclusion prevents unnecessary promotion of incremental versions to 
subsequent environments. To include redundant versions in a snapshot, edit the snapshot to add the redundant versions.



### High-level qualifiers


To ignore the high-level qualifier during redundant version calculations, set the **High 
Level Qualifier Length** value in the component configuration.




### MVS component template





### MVS component 
template


The z/OS Utility plug-in includes the MVSTEMPLATE component template. The template contains default 
processes, which can be used directly. The template also lists the component properties and environment properties that 
that must be set to run z/OS deployments.


### Default processes




| Deploy | Deploy data sets. Version artifacts are
 fetched from the CodeStation repository on the z/OS system. |
| Deploy get artifacts using FTP | Deploy data sets. 
Version artifacts are fetched from the Codestation repository by using FTP. |
| Remove all versions | Remove all 
versions in an environment, including the backup created during version deployment. Use this process to start a new 
round of development with a clean environment. Audit history is available even if versions were removed from the 
environment. |
| Remove redundant versions | Remove redundant versions in an environment. Redundant versions are 
versions that are replaced completely by versions that are deployed later. |
| Remove redundant versions with manual 
verification | Remove redundant versions in an environment. Redundant versions are versions that are replaced completely

### Submitting a JCL job and then checking for status





### Example: Submitting a JCL job and then checking for 
status


The process runs the following steps in order:


1. The [Submit Job](https://www.urbancode.com/plugindoc/z-os-
utility/#tab-steps) step starts the JCL job.
2. The Shell step represents other processing steps to take while the JCL 
job runs.
3. The [Wait For Job](https://www.urbancode.com/plugindoc/z-os-utility/#tab-steps) step stops processing until
 the JCL job completes.

### Deploying a component 
to the z/OS platform>





### Example: Deploying a component to the z/OS platform


In this process example, the z/OS 
data sets must be in the component. Also, the environment contains agents that are running z/OS. The process runs the 
following steps in order:


1. The [Copy Artifacts](https://www.urbancode.com/plugindoc/z-os-utility/#tab-steps) step 
loads the artifacts that make up the z/OS component version. Use the [FTP 
Artifacts](https://www.urbancode.com/plugindoc/z-os-utility/#tab-steps) step if build and deployment are on two 
different z/OS systems.
2. The [Deploy Data Sets](https://www.urbancode.com/plugindoc/z-os-utility/#tab-steps) step 
deploys the component version to z/OS.
