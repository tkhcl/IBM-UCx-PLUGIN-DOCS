z/OS Management Facility - Overview
===================================

# Overview


### Overview




The z/OS Management Facility (zOSMF) plug-in provides functions to discover software instances provisioned by[z/OSMFCloud Provisioning](https://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/features/zosmf/)or[z/OS Provisioning Toolkit](https://developer.ibm.com/mainframe/products/zospt/). A collection of resources are created inthe resource tree torepresent thesoftware instances such as CICS regions, WebSphere Liberty profile, MQ queues, and DB2 databases.

Discovering resources takes less time than manually creating resources to match the sub systems. For additional information about discovering resources, see the following topics:

* [Discovering Mainframe Software Services Instances](#discovering-mainframe-software-services-instances)
* [Provisioning and Discovering Mainframe Software Services Instances](#provisioning-discovering-mainframe-software-services-instances)

This plug-in includes the following steps:

* [Create Workflow](#create_workflow)
* [Start Workflow](#start_workflow)
* [Run Published Software Service Template](#run_published_software_service_template)
* [Software Services Instance Discovery](#software_services_instance_discovery)
* [zOSMF Cloud Provisioning Discovery](#zosmf_cloud_provisioning_discovery)

The following roles are added by this plug-in.

* [zOSMFService](#zosmfservice_role)
* [zOSMFSoftwareInstance](#zosmfsoftwareinstance_role)
