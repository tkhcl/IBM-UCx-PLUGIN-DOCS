### Step palette

click **Source and Repositories** > **Team Foundation Server**.


### Compatibility


This plug-in supports Team 
Foundation Server 2010 2017 using XAML builds. **Note:** XAML builds have been deprecated since TFS 2015 and new ones 
cannot be created. If using a different TFS build type, please use the VSTS plug-in. The VSTS plug-in supports all build
 types.


This plug-in requires version 6.0 or later of IBM UrbanCode Deploy.


For UrbanCode Deploy 6.0, both the agent
 and the server must be installed on Microsoft Windows. For UrbanCode Deploy 6.0.1 or later, only the agent is required 
to be on a system running Microsoft Windows.


The agent computer must have access to the Microsoft Team Foundation 
Server. Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 must be installed on the agent computer.


### Installation


This plug-in is 
installed when installing IBM UrbanCode Deploy. When new plug-in versions are available, follow the [installation 
instructions](https://www.urbancode.com/resource/installing-plug-ins-in-urbancode-products/ "Installing plug-ins in
