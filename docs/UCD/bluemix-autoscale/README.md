IBM Bluemix Auto-Scaling
========================


This plug-in provides steps to interact with the Auto-Scaling for Bluemix service by using the REST API. Currently the plug-in supports attaching an Auto-Scaling policy to a Bluemix application with authorization support from the IBM Containers plug-in.

* The [IBM Containers plug-in](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/plugin/cloud-foundry-ibm-containers/) is an installation prerequisite for the IBM Bluemix Auto-Scaling plug-in. The IBM Containers plug-in is required to log in to and log out from the Bluemix console.
* The Auto-Scaling service must first be configured on your Bluemix workspace or application.
