Apache Ant
==========


Apache Ant is a command line tool that is used to automate the build and deployment of applications. This plug-in calls 
the Ant executable to run one or more targets defined in a specified Ant script file, and is very useful for quickly 
integrating legacy automation into your UrbanCode Deploy Processes. IBM UrbanCode Deploy agents include a distribution 
of Ant, which is used by default, but other versions can be used by providing the path to the Ant installation directory
 in your Process Step.


**Platform Support:**


* This plug-in is supported to run on all operating systems supported 
by the UrbanCode Deploy agent, except for z/OS
* This plug-in is supported to run against Apache Ant v1.6.5 or higher




Available Steps
